# GoActiv
Web Application: Activity tracking platform

This application can be run using web2py. It is hosted on
https://nojha.pythonanywhere.com/project/default/index. Using this application
locally on 127.0.0.1 will not work because the redirect url for the Fitbit OAuth
2.0 authentication is set to pythonanywhere.com on the Fitbit developer account.
